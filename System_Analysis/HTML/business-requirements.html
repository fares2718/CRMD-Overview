      <h2 class="text-success">Business Requirements</h2>
      <article class="text-primery">
        <h4 class="text-success">Centralized Operational Control</h4>
        <p>
          business requires a unified system that manages all restaurant
          operations—including purchasing, inventory control, recipe costing,
          POS activities, table management, and billing—from a single platform.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Accurate Stock Tracking</h4>
        <p>
          The business needs a reliable way to track ingredient quantities in
          real time, detect low-stock situations, and identify discrepancies
          between expected and actual stock levels.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Reduction of Waste and Loss</h4>
        <p>
          The business requires clear visibility into consumption vs. waste to
          minimize losses caused by spoilage, overuse, employee mistakes, or
          theft.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">TCost & Profit Visibility</h4>
        <p>
          The business must know the exact cost of each menu item based on real
          ingredient prices and recipes, and monitor profit margins dynamically
          when costs change.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Supplier & Purchasing Control</h4>
        <p>
          The business needs a quick, intuitive way to manage tables, track
          order status, assign waiters, and handle dine-in, takeaway, and
          delivery operations smoothly.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Fast & Accurate Billing</h4>
        <p>
          The business requires fast generation of bills with minimal errors,
          support for discounts/promotions, splitting/merging bills, and
          flexible payment methods.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Clear Financial Visibility</h4>
        <p>
          The business needs to monitor daily revenue, outstanding supplier
          payments, total costs, and financial performance through accurate,
          up-to-date reports.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">Improved Staff Productivity</h4>
        <p>
          The system must streamline workflows for cashiers, waiters,
          storekeepers, and managers to reduce time wasted on manual tasks and
          improve service speed. 
        </p>
         <h4 class="text-success">Data & Audit Trails</h4>
          <p>
            The business
            requires full history of stock movements, price changes, supplier
            payments, order records, and waste logs to support accountability and
          auditing. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-success">Document Archiving & Traceability </h4>
          <p>
          The business needs to
          digitally store all supplier invoices, receipts, and delivery notes to
          simplify verification and reduce paper dependency. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-success">Accurate Daily</h4>
          <ul>
             Monitoring The restaurant must be able to track: 
             <li>items</li> 
             <li>sold</li>
             <li>items consumed</li>
             <li>revenue generated </li>
             <li>stock used</li>
             <li>staff</li>
             <li>performance</li>
             <li>discount impact on a daily basis for decision-making.</li>
          </ul>
         
         <h4 class="text-success"></h4>High System Reliability & Data Consistency</h4> 
          <p>
          The business requires a
          stable, offline-capable desktop system (POS) that guarantees data
          integrity even during peak hours.
          </p> 
        <h4 class="text-success">Role-Based Access Control</h4> 
           <p>
           The
          business needs users to have different permissions (admin, waiter,
          cashier, storekeeper, accountant), ensuring sensitive operations are
          protected. 
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-success">Scalability for Multiple Branches (Future Requirement)</h4>
          <p>
          The system should be designed to support multiple branches and
          centralized management in the future without major rework.
