      <article class="text-primery">
        Café & Restaurant Management System The system is a fully integrated
        platform designed to manage all operational, financial, and
        inventory-related activities within a café or restaurant. It connects
        purchasing, stock control, recipe costing, POS operations, table
        management, billing, staff roles, and reporting into one unified,
        data-driven environment. This isn’t just a POS. It’s the operational
        brain of the restaurant.
        <h4 class="text-success">Primary Goal</h4>
        Provide a centralized, efficient, and accurate system that:
        <ul>
          <li>tracks stock and consumption</li>
          <li>manages purchases and suppliers</li>
          <li>processes orders and tables</li>
          <li>calculates recipe cost and profitability</li>
          <li>generates financial and operational reports</li>
          <li>
            reduces waste, errors, and manual work Ultimately giving owners and
            managers full visibility over daily performance and profitability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-success">Core Modules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Supplier & Purchasing Management Handles supplier records, purchase
            invoices, payment tracking, and automatic stock updates. Stores
            supporting documents and evaluates supplier performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inventory Management Real-time quantity tracking, low-stock alerts,
            stock transactions, daily consumption logging, waste tracking, and
            stock variance analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recipe Costing Each menu item is defined as a recipe containing
            ingredient quantities and costs. The system calculates the cost per
            item, profit margin, and updates pricing impact when ingredient
            costs change.
          </li>
          <li>
            POS & Table Management Interactive table layout, open/close orders,
            transfer tables, merge/split bills, assign waiters, track dining
            duration, support Dine-In / Takeaway / Delivery workflows.
          </li>
          <li>
            Billing & Discounts Order billing, printing or digital invoicing,
            percentage/fixed discounts, promo codes, happy-hour rules, and
            permission-based discount control.
          </li>
          <li>
            Daily Consumption & Waste Analysis Records actual usage of raw
            materials, compares expected vs. actual consumption, highlights
            waste sources, and produces consumption insights.
          </li>

          <li>
            Reporting & Analytics Comprehensive reports: purchases, stock
            movements, waste, recipe profitability, sales by item/table/waiter,
            discount usage, and daily/weekly/monthly revenue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-success">Target Users</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Owners & managers (operations and profitability overview)</li>
          <li>Accountants (purchases, payments, financials)</li>
          <li>Storekeepers (stock and receiving)</li>
          <li>Cashiers (billing)</li>
          <li>Waiters (orders and tables)</li>
        </ul>
        Each role has permissions tailored to its responsibilities.
        <h4 class="text-success">Technology & Architecture</h4>
        <p>I'm building the system using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ADO.NET for maximum performance and full SQL control</li>
          <li>
            Clean Architecture to decouple business rules, data access, and UI
          </li>
          <li>Server for strong relational data modeling</li>
          <li>Desktop application stack Avalonia UI</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-success">How the System Works</h4>
        Purchases enter the system. Stock levels update automatically. Menu
        items consume inventory through recipes as orders are placed. Inventory
        decreases and transactions are logged. Reports analyze performance and
        financial outcomes. Every action leaves a data footprint in the
        database, powering real-time insights and accurate analytics.
        <h4 class="text-success">Real Business Value</h4>
        <span>Restaurant owners care about practical answers: </span>
        <ul>
          <li>Where is stock disappearing?</li>
          <li>Why did waste spike today?</li>
          <li>Why did latte cost increase suddenly?</li>
          <li>Which items are most profitable?</li>
          <li>Which suppliers cause delays?</li>
          <li>How much cash went out today?</li>
          <li>How much came in?</li>
        </ul>
        <span>
          This system converts daily chaos into measurable, transparent data.
        </span>
        <h4 class="text-success">Summary</h4>
        A data-driven operational platform that merges inventory, purchasing,
        POS, recipe costing, billing, and analytics into one ecosystem. It helps
        restaurants run faster, more accurately, and more profitably — with real
        visibility, not guesswork.
